# Conclusion:
President Clinton was right about the number of years each party held the White House (thank goodness he got that right),
but he was laughably wrong about the number of private jobs during each party's presidencies.
Clinton claimed that **24 million** jobs were produced during Republican years, but there were actually **28.5 million** -- a difference of **4.5 million**.
Clinton claimed that **42 million** jobs were produced during Democrat years, but there were only **23 million** -- a dfference of **-19 million**.
