function [ repPos, pinCodeFix ] = pinCodeCheck( pinCode )

%a pin code may be any length of digits, however it cannot have two identical digits next to eachother.
%this function will take an array of any size and remove repeating numbers (that are next to eachother). 
%repPos will return the positions in array pinCode that were removed.
%pinCodeFix will return pinCode, but without the duplicating numbers.

    repPos = []; %declares repPos as an empty array
    preLog = ones(1,length(pinCode)); %generates an array of 1s that will later be converted to a logical array.
    
    for (i = [1:length(pinCode)-1]) %this loop will check each digit, to make sure the following digit is not identical.
        if ( pinCode(i)==pinCode(i+1) )
            repPos(end+1) = i+1; %adds the position of repeated digit to the end of repPos.
            preLog(i+1) = 0; %changes the position of repeated digit to 0 so that it will not print in pinCodeFix.
        end
    end
    
    logPin = logical(preLog); %converts the preLog to a logical array.
    pinCodeFix = pinCode(logPin); %prints the new pincode without repeating digits.
    
end
